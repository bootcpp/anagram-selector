# Anagram Selector

This project uses the
[catch framework](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#top)
to test functionality.

## Anagrams

For definition and examples, [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)

## The task

Two functions need to be implemented:

1. Determine whether two words are anagrams or not
1. Select anagrams of a word from a list of words.

Tests of these functions are failing. Implement the functions and pass the tests.
